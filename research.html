<p>Galaxy evolution through cosmic time can only be understood by studying the properties of galaxies with multi-wavelength extragalactic survey. In particular, it is known that galaxy evolution is closely related to the large scale environment (the dark matter
halos) they reside in, and the evolution of galaxies and the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in their centers are also closely connected. 

<p>To uncover the mechanisms that scale the systems from a few AU to mega-parsec scale, I'm currently working on research projects about the correlation between the supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. My work involves analyzing multi-wavelength observations in the Bo&ouml;tes field, including data from <i>Chandra, Spitzer, Herschel</i>, the  AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey (AGES) catalog and NOAO Deep Wide Field Survey (NDWFS). The goal of my research is to put together a more complete picture on the evolution of galaxies, AGNs and the dark matter halos.

    Ever since the discovery of the tight correlation between the galaxy bulge mass and the SMBH mass for nearly every massive galaxies, a large number of studies have been trying to look for the underlying physical mechanisms that drive this correlation. The searches so far focused mostly on AGN and AGN host galaxies, where the SMBHs are most actively growing. However, recent simulations (and some observational evidence) have shown that the time scale of the variability of AGN accretion rate is <b>much shorter</b> than the time scale of star-formation.
<br>
<br>

Therefore, we propose that the we should focus on studying the
	<b>average</b> SMBH accretion in star-forming galaxies to
	truly uncover the link between the growth of SMBHs and their
	host galaxies. Please see my <a

	<h1>AGN Obscuration and host galaxy star formation </h1><p>
</hgroup>

A simple explanation of the close correlation between black hole
accretion and star formation is that they are both fueled by the same
gas reservoir. This is consistent with a well-established galaxy
evolution scenario in which rapid star formation and active SMBH
accretion are fueled by events of gas-rich major mergers. In this
scenario, galaxies first go through a dust-enshrouded starburst phase
with a heavily obscured central AGN. Later on, the powerful radiation
from the central AGNs drive the gas and dust away from the galaxies
and shut down the star formation. 
<br>
<br>
By studying mid-IR selected, luminous quasars in the Bootes survey
region, we find that the far-IR emission in quasar host galaxies is
directly connected to the quasar obscuration. With careful SED fitting
, X-ray and far-IR stacking analysis, we confirmed that the obscured quasars are hosted by galaxies
with at least two times higher star formation rate than the unobscured
quasars. This suggests that in
addition to the typical ``torus'' AGN unification model, the dust star
forming AGN hosts is also a very important source of obscuration. Some
of our mid-IR quasars show signs of extrem obscurations in the X-ray
and the optical. Since the most rapid growth of galaxy and SMBH
happens at this dust-enshrouded phase, it is important to include
these heavily obscured AGN population when search for evidence of the
AGN-galaxy coevolution. This work is accepted for publication in ApJ and
is also available at <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1501.04959">arXiv</a>.

The growth rate of an SMBH is probably the most important physical parameter
in its evolution. Observationally, the SMBHs are believed to grow
through the rapid accretion of gas in AGNs. Typically,
a radiatively efficient accretion process can efficiently convert 10%
of the accreted rest mass into radiation (bolometric). While it is
not realistic to expect that we can measure the SMBH accretion rates
with a contemporary, panchromatic observation of AGNs, there are many
effective AGN accretion rate estimators that are commonly used to
convert observables to AGN bolometric luminosity (hence the SMBH
accretion rate). In particular, I am investigating two AGN accretion
rate indicators: the AGN mid-IR luminosity and the AGN X-ray
luminosity. This is crucial because astronomers are just begining to
truly understand the ``dust-obscured'' AGNs in the last decade. Since
mid-IR might sometimes be the only AGN accretion rate indicator that's
available for heavily obscured sources, it is important to understand
how well the AGN mid-IR luminosity traces the intrinsic SMBH accretion
rate. In my recent study, I choose to study the correlation between
AGN mid-IR luminosity and X-ray luminosity, since X-ray is often considered as an excellent SMBH accretion
rate indicator.
<br>
<br>

In local AGNs, (the low to moderate luminosity Seyfert
galaxies), this two monochromatic luminosities are almost linearly
correlated (Lutz+ 2004, Miaolino+ 2007 and Gandhi+ 2009). However, for
the most luminous quasars, different correlations were observed (Fiore+
2009), which suggests that quasars might have relatively weaker X-ray
luminosity when compared to the local X-ray to mid-IR luminosity
ratio. Recent studies with NuSTAR have also revealed some quasars to
have intrinsically weak X-ray emissions (e.g. Stern+ 2014, Lansbury 2014).
(NuSTAR can directly probe the ultra-hard X-ray photons, which are much less susceptible to the neutral gas
absorption than the lower energy (<10 keV) X-ray photons)

<br>
<br>

To explore the nature of AGN accretion rate indicators in quasars, I
have compiled several quasar catalogs and confirmed that on average,
the AGN X-ray to mid-IR luminosity ratio is indeed lower than the
local relation. This is essential in the studies of AGN and galaxy
coevolution since the choice of SMBH accretion rate indicators can
actually alter the interpretation of the results. (Chen et al. 2015b,
